# This is a very simple implementation of the UCT Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm in Python 2.7.
# The function UCT(rootstate, itermax, verbose = False) is towards the bottom of the code.
# It aims to have the clearest and simplest possible code, and for the sake of clarity, the code
# is orders of magnitude less efficient than it could be made, particularly by using a 
# state.GetRandomMove() or state.DoRandomRollout() function.
# 
# Example GameState classes for Nim, OXO and Othello are included to give some idea of how you
# can write your own GameState use UCT in your 2-player game. Change the game to be played in 
# the UCTPlayGame() function at the bottom of the code.
